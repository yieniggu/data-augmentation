# Image Augmentation

This repository contains a single script that allows to perform multiple image augmentation operations based on the imgaug python library.

### First edit: April 12, 2020

Added four types of augmentation: **flip**, **rotation**, **gaussian noise** and **gaussian blur**.

The main goal of this repo is to provide a simple way to implement a pipeline for multiple computer vision tasks that requires a great amount of examples on the datasets.
